Understanding Blockchain Indexing  
Blockchain technology, often likened to a digital ledger, securely records data in encrypted 
blocks distributed across a decentralized network. Each block in the chain not only contains a 
record of new transactions but also carries information from the preceding block. However, due 
to blockchain's sequential structure, the associated data is dispersed across numerous blocks 
without an inherent system for identifying or extracting specific, higher-level data. 
Blockchain indexing steps in to address this. It allows users to efficiently search and filter 
through blockchain data, akin to how one might use Google, Bing, or other search engines to 
find information on the internet. 
Challenges in Indexing Blockchain Data  
Indexing data within a decentralized infrastructure like blockchain presents several obstacles: 
1. Absence of a Standard Query Language: Blockchain's immutable nature complicates 
direct data reading, as it lacks a built-in query language similar to SQL in traditional 
databases. To access even basic information such as a user's transaction history, one 
would have to examine each block individually. 
2. Complexities in Data Retrieval: The node structure of blockchains, particularly those akin 
to Ethereum, complicates data retrieval. Historical records are typically spread across 
various events and stored in separate sections of a node. Limited access to these 
events in some public nodes can significantly slow down the query process. 
3. Limitations of Existing APIs: The APIs currently available are often restricted to basic 
queries. These include range queries (such as records from a specific timeframe or a 
certain number of transactions) and top-k queries (which rank different data points 
relatively). This limitation hinders the ability to conduct more complex data analyses or 
searches. 
Subgraphs: A Key Solution  
One of the most promising solutions to the challenges of indexing blockchain data is the use of 
subgraphs. Subgraphs are essentially predefined data structures that are designed to efficiently 
index and query data from a blockchain. 
What are Subgraphs?  
Subgraphs are open-source APIs that allow developers to extract data from a blockchain and 
store it in a structured format. They are designed to be flexible, allowing developers to define 
the data they want to extract and how they want to store it. This flexibility enables subgraphs to 

be used for a wide range of applications, from simple data retrieval to more complex data 
analysis. 
Advantages of Subgraphs  
1. Customized Data Views: Developers can create subgraphs tailored to their specific 
needs, focusing on the particular data they're interested in. 
2. Real-time Data Updates: Subgraphs can update their indexed data in real-time with each 
new block on the blockchain, ensuring up-to-date information. 
3. Decentralized and Open: Like blockchains, subgraphs can be hosted in a decentralized 
manner, promoting transparency and accessibility.
