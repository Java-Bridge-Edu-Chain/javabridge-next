Arbitrum Orbit Overview 
Arbitrum Orbit is an Optimistic rollup-based framework designed to empower web3 businesses 
by enabling the creation of custom, use case-specific Layer 2 (L2) or Layer 3 (L3) chains in a 
purely permissionless way. Orbit leverages the Arbitrum Nitro Tech stack, offering unparalleled 
scalability, advanced compression, full EVM compatibility, and soon-to-be-released cross-chain 
interoperability. Essentially, Arbitrum Orbit can be thought of as deployable and configurable 
instances of the Nitro stack, forming an ecosystem of independent chains. 
Key Features of Arbitrum Orbit  
1. Customizable Throughput: Orbit chains provide dedicated throughput, ensuring high 
performance and resource availability tailored to specific dApp requirements. 
2. EVM+ Compatibility: Support for multiple programming languages (Rust, C++, C, and 
Solidity) through Stylus, enabling flexible and cost-effective smart contract development. 
3. Predictable Gas Costs: Isolated transaction environments ensure stable and predictable 
gas fees, crucial for business cost forecasting. 
4. Broad Data Availability Options: Flexibility to choose data availability models, including 
Ethereum Layer 1 or Data Availability Committees (DACs) for off-chain storage. 
5. Robust Security: Leveraging Ethereum's security and the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack 
ensures a high level of security for Orbit chains.
