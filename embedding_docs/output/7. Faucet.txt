Obtaining Testnet Tokens  
To acquire testnet tokens for network transactions, utilize the dRPC faucet that distributes 
testnet ETH. Follow the verification process to receive your tokens. 
Verification Process  
To ensure fair and equitable access, you need to complete the following verification steps: 
1. dRPC Authorization 
○ Log in or create an account with dRPC. It's fast and free. 
2. Proof-of-Work 
○ This faucet requires mining for free testnet tokens to prevent abuse and spam. 
Note that the process of "mining" doesn't create new coins; it's just a time-limited 
method of protection. 
Connecting Wallet to Testnet  
Configure your wallet to connect to the Sepolia testnet where you can receive testnet ETH.
