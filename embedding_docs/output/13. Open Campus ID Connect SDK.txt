Why do i need this?  
To integrate your product with the OpenCampus ecosystem, you need to retrieve and associate 
the OCIDs of your users within your system. The "Connect with OCID" functionality works 
similarly to "Login with Twitter" or "Login with Google." Our product suite provides a JavaScript 
SDK that you can integrate into your site, enabling users to log into OCID with a simple button 
click. 
How long does it work?  
This SDK provides an OAuth/OIDC interface to facilitate integration for our partners. 
Javascript-based SDK  
● The SDK includes a JavaScript wrapper for our authentication APIs. 
● It also provides a set of React components for seamless integration into React 
applications. 
● Integration instructions are available in the package README on the public npm site. 
Interoperability  
● The Connect with OCID APIs fully implement the OIDC standard, allowing developers to 
choose custom integration with our authentication APIs. 
● We enforce the OIDC Code Flow with PKCE for enhanced security. 
Development  
● A Sandbox environment is available and can be easily activated in the SDK for 
development purposes. 
● The Sandbox environment does not require redirect_uri whitelisting, enabling developers 
to test their integrations before going live. 

Connecting to production  
By default, you will only be able to integrate with the “Sandbox” environment. To be whitelisted 
to interact with the production version, you will need to complete the following form! Make sure 
to give us the correct site link, as this will whitelist your app’s site at the domain level. 
The form is here: App Whitelisting Form.
