Automation & Off-chain Data 
The Problem  
In the realm of blockchain development, especially with decentralized applications (dApps), a 
significant challenge emerges in the form of limited auto-execution capabilities. Traditionally, 
smart contracts, despite their advanced functionalities, lack the inherent ability to initiate or call 
methods automatically. This limitation poses a hurdle in the seamless operation and scalability 
of blockchain applications. 
The Solution  
To address this gap, automation solutions have been developed. These systems are designed 
to monitor both on-chain and off-chain data sources continuously. They are programmed to 
recognize specific predefined conditions. Once these conditions are met, the automation system 
springs into action, executing the necessary transactions without human intervention. 
Use cases  
1. Auto Harvesting in DeFi: In decentralized finance applications, automation can manage 
yield farming strategies, harvesting rewards automatically when they reach a certain 
threshold, thereby optimizing the return on investment for users. 
2. Limit Orders in Trading: Automated systems can execute trades when certain price 
points are hit, mirroring the functionality of limit orders in traditional trading but within a 
decentralized environment.
