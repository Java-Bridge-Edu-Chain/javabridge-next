Zero Dev 
ZeroDev is a smart, white-labeled, and modular embedded wallet for building user-friendly 
Web3 experiences, particularly for DeFi applications. 
Smart: ZeroDev leverages account abstraction. White-labeled: ZeroDev doesn't have a UI -- it 
provides the underlying wallet logic that you can build a totally customized experience on top of. 
Modular: ZeroDev is built on top of Kernel, the most popular open-source smart account that 
supports ERC-7579 plugins for customizing wallet logic. ZeroDev is one of the most trusted 
solutions in AA, powering more than 50% of all AA wallets and a majority of DeFi volume that 
leverages AA.
