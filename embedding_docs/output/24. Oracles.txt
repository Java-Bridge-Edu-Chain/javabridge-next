Oracles 
Overview  
Blockchain oracles are third-party services or agents that provide smart contracts with external 
information and serve as bridges between blockchains and the external world. Because 
blockchains cannot access external data (outside of their network) due to their secure and 
deterministic nature, oracles are used to fetch, verify, and relay real-world data to smart 
contracts in a way that's trustworthy. 
Use Cases  
Decentalized Finance (DeFi)  
Oracles provide price feeds, enabling DeFi platforms to calculate token values, manage 
collateral, and execute liquidations. By sourcing data from various exchanges and financial 
platforms, oracles contribute to the robustness of DeFi applications. 
Gaming  
Blockchain-based gaming and betting platforms use oracles to determine the outcomes of 
events, such as sports matches or random number generation. By connecting to various data 
sources and verifying results, oracles ensure fair and transparent gaming experiences. 
Insurance  
Oracles can be employed in the insurance industry to automate claims processing and 
underwriting. They can fetch data related to weather conditions, flight delays, or health records, 
enabling insurers to create parametric insurance products. This reduces fraud and ensures 
quicker payouts based on predefined triggers.
