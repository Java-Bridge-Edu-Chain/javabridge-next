Layer Zero 
LayerZero is a messaging protocol, not a blockchain. Using smart contracts deployed on each 
chain, in combination with Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs) and Executors, LayerZero 
enables different blockchains to seamlessly interact with one another. 
Getting Started  
To start sending omnichain messages with LayerZero, you only need to implement two 
functions: 
 
● _lzSend: This function is used to send a message to a different chain. 
 
_lzSend( 
 _dstEid, // the destination endpoint id 
 _payload, // encoded message payload being sent 
 _options, // message execution options 
 MessagingFee(msg.value, 0), // the fee in native gas and ZRO token 
 payable(msg.sender) // refund address in case of failed source message 
); 
● _lzReceive: This function is used to receive a message from a different chain. 
 
function _lzReceive( 
 Origin calldata _origin, // struct containing srcEid, sender address, and the message nonce 
 bytes32 _guid, // global message packet identifier 
 bytes calldata payload, // encoded message being received 
 address _executor, // the address of who executed the message 
 bytes calldata _extraData // appended executor data for the call 
) internal override { 
 data = abi.decode(payload, (string)); // your receive logic here 
} 
 
LayerZero offers Contract Standards that simplify this implementation by providing out of the 
box message handling, interfaces for custom protocol configurations, and other quality of life 
improvements: 
● OApp: the base contract standard for omnichain messaging and configuration. 
● OFT: the base contract standard for omnichain messaging and configuration. 
Prerequisites  
1. You should first be familiar with writing and deploying contracts to your desired 
blockchains. This involves understanding the specific smart contract language and the 
deployment process for those chains. 

2. A wallet set up and funded for the chains you'll be working with. 
Deploying your Contracts  
note 
This example can be used with any EVM compatible chain. 
To learn how to deploy your contracts, please refer to the Deploying Contracts section. 
To checkout endpoint addresses please refer to the Endpoints section in the layerzero docs. 
Connecting your Contracts  
To connect your contracts, call setPeer and pass the address of your destination contract as a 
bytes32 value, as well as the destination endpoint ID. If successful, you now should be setup to 
start sending cross-chain messages! 
To go more in depth, please refer to the Getting Started section in the layerzero docs.
