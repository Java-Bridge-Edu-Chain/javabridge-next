What is a Bridge?  
Bridges are a way to connect two different blockchains. They are a special type of smart 
contract that allows you to lock up tokens on one blockchain and mint the same amount of 
tokens on another blockchain. This is a very useful feature, as it allows you to transfer tokens 
between different blockchains. For example, you can transfer tokens from the Ethereum 
blockchain to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain.
